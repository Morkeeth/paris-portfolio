// ── THE RECORD ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// STATS and the timeline are NOT declared here any more. They are FETCHED, at build,
// from the one published record (oscar-record/record.json), which is generated from the
// vault (00 Dashboard/record.md). That file is the source of truth.
//
// Why: this file used to CALL ITSELF "single source of truth" while being hand-typed,
// and rubin-summer-camp forked it. The registry listed 38 initiatives; this file listed
// 20 and none of the three shipped that week. The record was single-source; every
// rendering was a fork. Facts now arrive; only form lives here.
//
// Prose below still interpolates STATS. That stays: prose that restates a number drifts,
// and flattening prose into the record would bake the values back in.
