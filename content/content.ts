  short: "Staff PM @ Ledger building BTC/ETH/SOL experiences at scale. Previously founding product @ anotherblock (40k users, $2.1M volume). I design systems that feel simple on the surface and powerful underneath—by removing friction, aligning teams, and letting data sharpen instincts.",
  long:
    "I'm a product leader who makes complex infra feel effortless. At Ledger, I own parts of the BTC/ETH/SOL wallet roadmap—improving startup time (6s→3s), lifting swap success via UTXO/coin control, and expanding WalletConnect coverage. Before that, I helped found anotherblock, taking it from 0 to 40k users and $2.1M volume with Coinbase partnership and a compliant "Digital Vinyl" line (Rihanna, The Weeknd, Michael Jackson). I've shipped MVPs in days, scaled communities to hundreds, and run cross-functional programs with measurable gains in reliability, revenue, and retention. I like clarity, clean interfaces, and decision loops that get tighter over time."
